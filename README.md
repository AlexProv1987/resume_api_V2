# Resume Builder MVP

This is a Django + React project for building customizable, modular digital resumes. It's designed to allow non-technical users ("applicants") to configure how their resume appears, while giving developers the flexibility to extend and theme the system if they choose to fork it.

## üß† Project Goals

- ‚úÖ Build a personal-use digital resume tool
- ‚úÖ Serve as a real-world, full-stack portfolio piece
- ‚úÖ Balance extensibility with MVP pragmatism
- ‚úÖ Allow future forking by others with clean architecture
---

### üì¶ Plan & Subscription Enforcement
- Record creation and retrieval are capped based on applicant's current subscription plan
- Limits are enforced in both model mixins and DRF view mixins

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend
- Django 4+
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for caching)
- ContentType framework (for plan-aware limits)

### Frontend
- React + TypeScript
- React-Bootstrap
- Axios

---

## üß© Architecture Overview

### View Logic
- DRF views for each widget respect plan-based record limits
- Prefetch queries are capped based on subscription

## üóÉÔ∏è Developer Notes

### Deferred Features (Commented/Planned, not Implemented)
- Per-widget theming via `advanced_config`
- AI-powered resume assistant
- Resume is rendered by grouping widgets by page region
- `Page`, `Widget`, `PageWidget`: Developer-defined layout
- `ApplicantWidget`: Applicant-defined widget preferences (visibility, order)
- `WidgetInstanceOption`: Optional per-widget config for advanced users

These are intentionally deferred to keep the MVP focused and deployable. The architecture supports them cleanly if added later.

### Design Philosophy
> "Is this necessary for the user right now, or just satisfying for the engineer in me?"

This principle guided what got built and what got commented.

## üôè Thanks
Built by a developer for developers ‚Äî with clean separation between dev flexibility and non-technical user UX.

DMs welcome if you fork it and make something cool!
